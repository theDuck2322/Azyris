Azyris Todo list:

Done:
	change from pixel pased coordinates to meter(shrink the orthographic camera, 
		also rename the class and file to Camera2D)
	improve the renderer
	fix the chipmunk engine (collider class)
	remove the Az::Shapes::rect (its annoying to use)

TO do when programming again
	add to renderer a draw line and a draw rect but not filled (using 4 drawing)


Need to be done:


	add box2d to the engine so the engine will use 2 physics engine
	make abstractions for box2d
	make a particle system
	add different shapes to the batch renderer
